üéØ Usage Examples
Example 1: Movie Data Analysis
bashcurl -X POST "https://your-api.com/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Scrape the list of highest grossing films from Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films

Answer the following questions and respond with a JSON array:
1. How many $2 bn movies were released before 2020?
2. Which is the earliest film that grossed over $1.5 bn?
3. What's the correlation between Rank and Peak?
4. Draw a scatterplot of Rank vs Peak with a dotted red regression line."
Example 2: Court Data Analysis
bashcurl -X POST "https://your-api.com/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Analyze the Indian High Court dataset and respond with JSON object containing: Which court disposed most cases 2019-2022? What is the regression slope of registration to decision date delays by year for court 33_10? Create a scatterplot visualization of this data."
  }'
Example 3: Generic Data Analysis
bashcurl -X POST "https://your-api.com/api/" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
  -d "Load data from https://example.com/sales-data.csv and answer:
1. What are the total sales by region?
2. Which product has the highest growth rate?
3. Create a bar chart showing quarterly performance."
